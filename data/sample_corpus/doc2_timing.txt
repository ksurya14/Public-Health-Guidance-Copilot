Title: Timing of Influenza Vaccination

Vaccination should occur before influenza activity begins in the community.
Adults should ideally receive influenza vaccination by the end of October.

Vaccination later in the season is still beneficial and should continue as long as influenza viruses are circulating and vaccine supplies are available.
