Title: CDC Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Overview

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends annual influenza vaccination for everyone 6 months and older, with rare exceptions.
Vaccination should ideally occur before the end of October, but vaccination should continue to be offered throughout the season as long as influenza viruses are circulating.

The influenza vaccine composition is reviewed and updated yearly to match anticipated circulating strains.
